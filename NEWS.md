# worldmet 1.0.0

## Dependency Changes

- `arrow` has been added as a suggested dependency.

- `leaflet` has been downgraded to a suggested dependency. When a user requests a met station map they will be prompted to install `leaflet` if it is not already installed.

- `mirai` and `carrier` have been upgrade to imported dependencies. This is because they are always required by `purrr::in_parallel()` regardless of whether parallelisation is being used or not.

## New Features

The Global Historical Climate Network (GHCN) has officially superseded NOAA's Integrated Surface Database (ISD). Many changes in this release are related to this external change.

- Added `import_ghcn_stations()`, `import_ghcn_inventory()`, and `import_ghcn_countries()` to grant access to metadata for the GHCN.

- Added `import_ghcn_hourly()`, `import_ghcn_daily()` and `import_ghcn_monthly()` to grant access to the GHCNh, GHCNd and CHCNm services.

- Added `import_isd_stations()`, `import_isd_hourly()` and `import_isd_lite()` to provide a consistent API with the newly added GHCN functions.

- Added `write_met()`, which allows for hourly ISD and GHCN and daily GHCN data to be easily split into years and sites and written to file. This is a more flexible alternative to using `importNOAA(path=)`.

## Deprecations

Several functions have been deprecated and replaced due to the updated `worldmet` API:

- `getMeta()` -> `import_isd_stations()`

- `getMetaLive()` -> `import_isd_stations_live()`

- `importNOAA()` -> `import_isd_hourly()`

- `importNOAAlite()` -> `import_isd_lite()`

- `exportADMS()` -> `write_adms()`

- the `path` argument -> `write_met()`

## Bug Fixes 

- `rlang::%||%` is now explicitly imported by `worldmet` to avoid issues in old version of R.

# worldmet 0.10.2

## Dependency Changes

- `worldmet` no longer depends on `openair`.

## New Features

- `importNOAA()` now recommends trying the other `source` if it fails to fetch data (i.e., if `source = "delim"` fails, the user will be prompted to try `source = "fwf"`).

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed `source = "fwf"` failing when importing data from closed stations.

- Fixed `source = "fwf"` when `hourly = TRUE` and multiple sites are imported.

- Removed present weather condition when `source = "fwf"`.

# worldmet 0.10.1

## New Features

- `importNOAAlite()` has gained the `path` argument, in line with `importNOAA()`.

- `importNOAAlite()` now supports parallel processing using the `{mirai}` package, in line with `importNOAA()`.

## Bug Fixes

- `importNOAAlite()` can now import data from years other than 2025.

# worldmet 0.10.0

## New Features 

- Parallel importing of NOAA data is now powered by `{mirai}`. This reduces the number of dependencies of `{worldmet}`, and also allows users to be more flexible with how parallel processing is achieved.

    - Due to this change, users are recommended to set `mirai::daemons()` themselves. `n.core` will stil work for back-compatibility, but will give a once-per-session warning.

- `getMeta()` has gained the `crs` argument to search NOAA ISD stations by coordinates other than latitude and longitude.

- Added `importNOAALite()` to access the ISDLite filestore.

- Added the `importNOAA(source=)` argument to import ISD data from different file stores. This option can be useful if one of the file stores is not available for whatever reason.

- All error and warning messages are now powered by `{cli}` and are more informative.

# worldmet 0.9.9

## New Features

- The `quiet` argument of `importNOAA()` now also toggles the progress bar.

## New Features

- `getMeta()` has gained the `crs` argument, which allows `getMeta(lat =, lon =)` to be defined using other coordinate systems.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed join problem due to `{dplyr}` updates.

- Fixed spelling mistakes in `weatherCodes`

- Converted the `{worldmet}` vignette to an article. This should ensure it is no longer reliant on NOAA's servers. It can now be accessed at <https://openair-project.github.io/worldmet/articles/worldmet.html>.

# worldmet 0.9.6

## New Features

- `importNOAA()` will now display a progress bar when multiple years of met data are to be imported.

- Improved the formatting of the popups in `getMeta()` in line with `openairmaps::networkMap()`.

- Added the `provider` argument to `getMeta()`, allowing for users to define one or more `leaflet` basemaps. Uses the same default as `openairmaps::networkMap()`.

- `exportADMS()` now invisibly returns the input data, in line with, e.g., `readr::write_csv()`.

# worldmet 0.9.5

## Bug Fixes

- do not add precip to `exportADMS()`

- Cloud cover data mostly spans 1 to 8 Oktas and no zero (clear sky); use `ceil_hgt = 220000` (unlimited) to indicate clear sky when cloud cover is reported as missing.

- Do not use ftp for site information.

# worldmet 0.9.4

## Bug Fixes

- Fix precipitation. The `precip_12` gives the sum of the precipitation over the past 12 hours and the sum of this column should be the annual total in mm. `precip` spreads the 12-hour total evenly across the previous 12 hours. `{worldmet}` no longer tries to combine 12 and 6 hour totals.

# worldmet 0.9.3

## Bug Fixes

- Catch missing data error and report missing when importing data using `importNOAA()`

# worldmet 0.9.2

## New Features

- Exporting `weatherCodes` so that everything works when used by other packages through "explicit namespacing"" (_e.g._ `worldmet::importNOAA()`) without having to `library(worldmet)`.

# worldmet 0.9.1

## Bug Fixes

- fix bug when lat and lon provided in `getMeta()`

- fix bug when several years are selected and columns are different lengths when `n.core = 1`

# worldmet 0.9.1

## New Features

- Significant changes due to NOAA storage formats and different storage locations

- Remove options for precipitation and present weather in `importNOAA()`; just return everything

- Return data as `{tibble}`

# worldmet 0.8.8

## New Features

- export `getMetaLive()` to allow users direct access to all meta data and easy re-use without re-downloading.

- add option `path` to allow users to save met data as an rds file.

- deprecate `fresh` option in `getMeta()`.

- Assume `9999` is missing for visibility (was `999999`)

## Bug Fixes

- fix short WBAN codes.

- make sure all meta data are used and not only sites with most recent year

# worldmet 0.8.4

## New Features

- query live meta data when using `getMeta()`.

- parallel processing for sites and years.

- use `readr::read_csv()` for meta data (`read.csv()` seems very slow in R 3.4.3).

## Bug Fixes

- fix bug when data not available for a year when using parallel processing

# worldmet 0.8.0

## New Features

- downloads now from webserver rather than ftp. Should be faster and allow more downloads. Thanks to Stuart Grange.

- add parallel processing using `{foreach}`.

# worldmet 0.7.4

## Bug Fixes

- don't use `closeAllConnections()`.

# worldmet 0.7.3

## New Features

- default to downloading fresh meta data each time.

- update meta data.

## Bug Fixes

- fix current year problem (base on meta data available in package).

# worldmet 0.7.2

## Bug Fixes

- make sure data are returned with `NA` when missing and not `NaN`.

# worldmet 0.6 

## New Features

- Add ability to return precipitation measurements, if available.

- Add precipitation to `exportADMS()`
