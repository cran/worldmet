\usage{
importNOAA(
  code = "037720-99999",
  year = 2014,
  hourly = TRUE,
  precip = FALSE,
  PWC = FALSE,
  parallel = TRUE,
  quiet = FALSE,
  path = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{code}{The identifing code as a character string. The code is a
combination of the USAF and the WBAN unique identifiers. The codes are
sperated by a \dQuote{-} e.g. \code{code = "037720-99999"}.}

\item{year}{The year to import. This can be a vector of years e.g.
\code{year = 2000:2005}.}

\item{hourly}{Should hourly means be calculated? The default is \code{TRUE}.
If \code{FALSE} then the raw data are returned.}

\item{precip}{Should precipitation measurements be returned? If \code{TRUE}
the 12-hourly and 6-hourly totals are returned (if available). In
addition, an hourly sequence is also returned, as described below.}

\item{PWC}{Description of the present weather conditions (if available).}

\item{parallel}{Should the importing use mutiple processors? By default the
number of cores - 1 are used.}

\item{quiet}{If FALSE, print missing sites / years to the screen.}

\item{path}{If a file path is provided, the data are saved as an rds file at 
the chosen location e.g.  \code{path = "C:/Users/David"}. Files are saved by year and site.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame of surface observations. The data frame is
  consistent for use with the \code{openair} package. NOTE! the data are
  returned in GMT (UTC) time zone format. Users may wish to express the data
  in other time zones e.g. to merge with air pollution data.
}
\description{
Main function for importing meteorological data
}
\details{
This is the main function to import data from the NOAA Integrated Surface
Database (ISD). The ISD contains detailed surface meteorological data from
around the world for over 30,000 locations. For general information of the
ISD see \url{https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/isd} and the map here
\url{https://gis.ncdc.noaa.gov/map/viewer/#app=cdo&cfg=cdo&theme=hourly&layers=1}.

Note the following units for the main variables:

\describe{

\item{date}{Date/time in POSIXct format. \strong{Note the time zone is GMT
(UTC) and may need to be adjusted to merge with other local data. See
details below.}}

\item{lat}{Latitude in decimal degrees (-90 to 90).}

\item{lon}{Longitude in decimal degrees (-180 to 180). Negative numbers are
west of the Greenwich Meridian.}

\item{elev}{Elevention of site in metres.}

\item{wd}{Wind direction in degrees. 90 is from the east.}

\item{ws}{Wind speed in m/s.}

\item{sky_ceiling}{The height above ground level (AGL) of the lowest cloud
or obscuring phenomena layer aloft with 5/8 or more summation total sky
cover, which may be predominantly opaque, or the vertical visibility into a
surface-based obstruction.}

\item{visibility}{The visibility in metres.}

\item{air_temp}{Air temperature in degrees Celcius.}

\item{dew_point}{The dew point temperature in degrees Celcius.}

\item{sea_level_press}{The sea level pressure in millibars.}

\item{RH}{The relative humidity (\%).}

\item{cl_1,  ...,  cl_3}{Cloud cover for different layers in Oktas (1-8).}

\item{cl}{Maximum of cl_1 to cl_3 cloud cover in Oktas (1-8).}

\item{cl_1_height, ..., cl_3_height}{Height of the cloud base for each later
in metres.}

\item{precip_12}{12-hour precipitation in mm.}

\item{precip_6}{6-hour precipitation in mm.}

\item{precip}{Based on the 12 hourly and 6 hourly totals, \code{precip}}
spreads the 6-hourly totals across the previous 6-hours to provide an
indication of hourly precipitation.

\item{pwc}{The description of the present weather description (if
available).}

}

The data are returned in GMT (UTC). It may be necessary to adjust the time
zone when comining with other data. For example, if air quality data were
available for Beijing with time zone set to "Etc/GMT-8" (note the negative
offset even though Beijing is ahead of GMT. See the \code{openair} package
and manual for more details), then the time zone of the met data can be
changed to be the same. One way of doing this would be \code{attr(met$date,
"tzone") <- "Etc/GMT-8"} for a meteorological data frame called \code{met}.
The two data sets could then be merged based on \code{date}.

\examples{

\dontrun{
## use Beijing airport code (see getMeta example)
dat <- importNOAA(code = "545110-99999", year = 2010:2011)
}
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{getMeta}} to obtain the codes based on various site
  search approaches.
